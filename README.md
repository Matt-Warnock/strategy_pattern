# Strategy Pattern Example

This example is simulating ducks. All ducks are inherited from the abstract class Duck. But not all ducks have the same behavior, what about rubber ducks? What about decoy ducks?

## Description of pattern

The strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets algorithms vary independently of clients that use it.
